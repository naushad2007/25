Beds-Queen, Full, 2 Twins Miles to Beach-2 miles to Seagull Beach Guest Review: :<i>This was such an incredible surprise from the moment we arrived at Swan Pond. The house was great; extremely organized, very clean, everything was neatly placed and easy to find.&nbsp;</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>The view from the living room out to Swan Pond was just incredible. We sat with coffee watching the magnificent sunrises in the morning and again in the evening with the reflection across the pond from the sunsets. Our favorite spot was sitting down by the private beach with the bonfire at night toasting marshmallows, and watching the swans make their way back across the lake to settle for the night. We counted 22 swans at one time and realized how calming swans are to watch. "&nbsp;</i></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i>The location itself is so convenient to local shops and restaurants and of course the seafood market, which became our favorite spot. We drove to a different beach every day. Five minutes away we were able to jump on the Ferry across to Nantucket for the day. We give this special house on the Cape FIVE stars. We loved it so much, we will be booking up again. Jannice, Tony and Benjamin.
